# Deployment guide

Follow this checklist to get the righ hardware ready:

- [] Make sure that all your nanos are properly powered with supplies capable of delivering **3A** of current.
- [] Run `sanitycheck.sh` in all your nanos to check that all necessary libraries are installed.
- [] Make sure that all your RealSense cameras are plugged to your nanos **using the original cables**. When you run `realsense-viewer` on your nano your camera must appear as USB3, a downgrade to USB2 can be caused by a bad cable and then nothing will work.
